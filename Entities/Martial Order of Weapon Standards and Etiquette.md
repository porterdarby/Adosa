The Martial Order of Weapon Standards and Etiquette (MOWSE), is an organization that traces its origin to [Sorghan](../Locations/Adosa/Sorghan.md). Originally a tradesman's union focused on establishing standards for weapons and armor coming out of the city and eliminating unfair business practices, the organization has since evolved into a sort of club for those who are training in any of the martial arts.

Its various branches include (but are not limited to):

* DagU, the Daggerists Union
* BeAVr, the Brotherhood of Archery Veterans
* RAT, the Rapier Association of Tournaments
* PiKA, the Polearm Kindred Alliance

Performances held by these branches are a celebrated part of the town's history. There has even been a recent surge of tourism to come see these martial displays, prompting some members to begin touring to exhibit their skills.
