Female wizard, difficult to know if she's human since she's "out of this world". As she is a [[dame]], she owns one of the [Towers of the Knights](../../Locations/Adosa/Towers%20of%20the%20Knights.md).

* Put us in a position where we left the tower and eventually met [Darcough](../Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md)
* [Golem](../Player%20Characters/Golem.md) had theories that while she appears human, she was hiding her true race.
* [The Party](../Player%20Characters/The%20Party.md) has been working with Idrissa for 2 years now.
* She doesn't open her eyes as she speaks to us.
