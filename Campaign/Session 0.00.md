		* We've helped an individual leave a temple where they were stuck for eternity
* "You all... first met... in [Cleoro](../Locations/Adosa/Cleoro.md). But where was the first time that you all first stand together, sit together, or come together? [Darcough Damar](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md), where did the [five of you](../Entities/Player%20Characters/The%20Party.md) first meet together?"
	* [Darcough Damar](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md): Came across some bandits, helped by the group
* "[Golem](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Golem.md), how did you all fair?"
	* The other 4 came up on [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md) fighting the bandits. [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md) was in over his head, and the rest have been able to save.
* "[Uuth](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Uuth.md): You all have made some allies. Tell me about one of them. Who were they, and how do they bind you all together"
	* [Uuth](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Uuth.md):
		* As I recall, we met [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md). The others met beforehand.

* "[Yta](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Yta.md): [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md), who is your enemy/rival?"

* [Yta](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Yta.md): "[Silas](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Silas%20Clarke.md), what is your current objective?"
	* "Last we spoke to [Idrissa](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Idrissa.md), she had told us that there was [Imp](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Imp.md) in [Cleoro](../Locations/Adosa/Cleoro.md), stirring up trouble. She asked us to look into him. He didn't have any information on him, but was tasked to watch over the city"
* _[retcon of the wizard]_
* [Yta](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Yta.md): "But [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md), as you started to look around the city for the imp, it was not what you seemed. [...] What caused you to question your current objective?"
	* [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md): "Not all fights are winnable at this point, we may not be strong enough"
	* [Yta](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Yta.md): "What specific threat did you learn about that made you question them?"
	* [Uuth](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Uuth.md): "[Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md), you mentioned enemies the size of buildings, enemies that would require special tools"
		* Almost titanic in size
* [Yta](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Yta.md): "There are still things left unknown to all who are present at the moment. And just between you and me, [Silas](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Silas%20Clarke.md), what poses a unrecognized risk that will catch everyone off gaurd?"
	* ~~[Silas](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Silas%20Clarke.md): "There is a warrant out for all of our arrests for an alleged crime that we know that we haven't committed, that the [city magistrate](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/city%20magistrate.md) truly believes that we are guilty"~~
* [Yta](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Yta.md): "[Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md), how close are you to your current obejctive, and what is the shape of the ground under your boots?"
	* [Dewind](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md): "I can feel my foot tapping on a wooden floor, with a room below it. ... I think I'm on a stage. And we were just starting to get some informatoin about this... [tower](../Locations/tower.md). I've never been to this town before, but this [tower](../Locations/tower.md) in [Cleoro](../Locations/Adosa/Cleoro.md)... why does it signify struggles?"

---

* Everyone is in the auditorium. [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md) is giving a speech about the power of divination magic, to be able to foretell the future.
	* Trying to tell them it can be used to stop calamity
* Applause breaks out from the audience
* [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md) hears in your ear (and the rest of [The Party](../Entities/Player%20Characters/The%20Party.md) can hear) from [Yta](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Yta.md) "and why here?"
	* "The [Red Fox Tavern](../Locations/Adosa/Red%20Fox%20Tavern.md) is the largest tavern in all of [Cleoro](../Locations/Adosa/Cleoro.md), it just makes sense".
	* [Silas](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Silas%20Clarke.md): "We've heard rumors about people who have interacted with [the Imp](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Imp.md)"
* ~~[Yta](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Yta.md): "[Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md), you know about what awaits you outside the [Red Fox Tavern](../Locations/Adosa/Red%20Fox%20Tavern.md), and what unexpected tool did you bring with you?"~~
* [Yta](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Yta.md): "[Silas](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Silas%20Clarke.md), you know that in a crowd this size and in a city this size you know you will need to follow it immediately, to whatever end ahead of you. You have learned things that you are afraid of, enemies that have been watching, waiting for you to make a mistake. But you have been preparing, you have something. What are you headed towards, and what unexpected tool have you brought to deal with it?"
	* [Silas](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Silas%20Clarke.md): "We have recently have a run-in with a criminal organization of werewolves, and we've brought silver-tipped arrows to fend them off. Oh, it's also a full moon."
* [Yta](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Yta.md): "I didn't realize that denizens of [Ichana](../Locations/Ichana/Ichana.md) had made their way this far east"
* [Yta](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Yta.md): "The hours is late. [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md), your voice grows tired in your throat. ... All of you hear a creaking, a heavy groaning of the doors towards the front, immediately proceeding a breaking, a crunching."
	* The scratching of claws; a giant 6-armed werewolf mutant.
* Someone in this crowd has the information that you all want; a tip-off from [Idrissa](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Idrissa.md)  that the one contact about [the Imp](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Imp.md) is here tonight. [The Blood Hunters](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/The%20Blood%20Hunters.md) of [Ichana](../Locations/Ichana/Ichana.md) are trying to stop [you](../Entities/Player%20Characters/The%20Party.md) from getting this information.
* [The Party](../Entities/Player%20Characters/The%20Party.md) slays the beast. [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md) yells "Be calm! We have slain the beast!"
* Crowd members are leaving, wanting to get home.
* Confusion, but immediate panic is dying down
* [Golem](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Golem.md) heals all of the "dead" people, brings them back from the brink with his "Balm of Peace"
* [Uuth](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Uuth.md) is attempting to keep people calm inside.
* [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md) wants to study the body
	* Cuts into the body, takes a while. Becomes more humanoid, but starts showing runes on the body
	* [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md) is marking down the sigils/runes (a "Sigil of Reconstruction" and a "Sigil of Unbreakable")
	* [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md) is watching [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md).
	* The two being talking about the structure/nature of the sigils. They postulate along different styles of enchantments, magic (how would one make a lasting impression). [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md) uses this runic language to influence change on objects.
	* There are some _shapes_ that do _things_. [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md) brings this idea up to [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md); with their understanding of languages, they come to that there must be something _in the body_ that the sigils are acting upon. This is effectively transmutation magic (or should be)
	* All these sigils that would mean "iron" indicate to [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md) that this is [Blood Magic](../Topics/Blood%20Magic.md).
	* [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md): "[Blood Magic](../Topics/Blood%20Magic.md). I have heard a few tales of this. We should find this in a library tomorrow."
* [Silas](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Silas%20Clarke.md) is attempting to make conversation with the commoners, partially trying to find information about [Imp](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Imp.md).
	* [Silas](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Silas%20Clarke.md) passes by a woman, being held tightly by a man who is comforting her
	* She smacks him on the chest, "I told you so!" ... "I swear this thing lived next door!" sounds like the [Imp](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Imp.md) was living next door in some capacity
	* [Silas](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Silas%20Clarke.md) asks where the woman lives, the man basically says "Dude, not now". Silas wants to stalk her home so that we can figure out where the imp lives.
		* She has a tattoo of a dog on her throat, right side
* Bartender comes back a little while later, sees the people in the center of the tavern, has a clear look of relief on his place.
	* Other staff start attending to the _large amount of blood_.
* _5 minutes later_: Guards show up
* Head is forming back from the werewolf, shifting back into more of a bovine aspect ([[minotaur]])
* _10 minutes later_: Heavy bootfalls coming through the door.
	* Number of the towns guards are making their way into the room
	* The head guard begins to move forward towards [Uuth](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Uuth.md)
	* "You and yours are wanted for murder. Of the noble variety."
	* "[Uuth](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Uuth.md) burned [Noel McCardiganAgin](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Noel%20McCardiganAgin.md) to death"
* Uuth is manacled, [Silas](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Silas%20Clarke.md) has a knife to the throat of the sheriff. [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md) throws the head of the were-minotaur at the gaurd trying to cuff him.
