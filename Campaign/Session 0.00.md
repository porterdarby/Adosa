		* Saw the town of [Cleoro](../Locations/Cleoro.md) in fire
		* Found [The Group](../Entities/Player%20Characters/The%20Group.md) at [[the boot]]
* "But more importantly, what is the clue that binds you?"
	* "Why did you stay together?"

	* [Silas Clarke](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Silas%20Clarke.md):
		* "We've made highways safe to travel"
		* We've helped an individual leave a temple where they were stuck for eternity
* "You all... first met... in [Cleoro](../Locations/Cleoro.md). But where was the first time that you all first stand together, sit together, or come together? [Darcough Damar](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md), where did the [five of you](../Entities/Player%20Characters/The%20Group.md) first meet together?"
	* [Darcough Damar](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md): Came across some bandits, helped by the group
* "[The Golem](../Entities/Player%20Characters/The%20Golem.md), how did you all fair?"
	* The other 4 came up on [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md) fighting the bandits. [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md) was in over his head, and the rest have been able to save.
* "[Uuth](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Uuth.md): You all have made some allies. Tell me about one of them. Who were they, and how do they bind you all together"
	* [Uuth](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Uuth.md):
		* As I recall, we met [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md). The others met beforehand.
		* We met a [Idrissa](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Idrissa.md) in a tower. 
* "[Eta](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Eta.md): [Dewind](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewind%20Merigar.md), who is your enemy/rival?"
	* [Myrrdin the Illusionist](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Myrrdin%20the%20Illusionist.md): An illusionist who trapped [Dewind](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewind%20Merigar.md) inside a maze for a week
* [Eta](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Eta.md): "[Silas](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Silas%20Clarke.md), what is your current objective?"
	* "Last we spoke to [Idrissa](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Idrissa.md), she had told us that there was [[an imp]] in [Cleoro](../Locations/Cleoro.md), stirring up trouble. She asked us to look into him. He didn't have any information on him, but was tasked to watch over the city"
* _[retcon of the wizard]_
* [Eta](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Eta.md): "But [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md), as you started to look around the city for the imp, it was not what you seemed. [...] What caused you to question your current objective?"
	* [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md): "Not all fights are winnable at this point, we may not be strong enough"
	* [Eta](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Eta.md): "What specific threat did you learn about that made you question them?"
	* [Uuth](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Uuth.md): "[Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md), you mentioned enemies the size of buildings, enemies that would require special tools"
		* Almost titanic in size
* [Eta](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Eta.md): "There are still things left unknown to all who are present at the moment. And just between you and me, [Silas](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Silas%20Clarke.md), what poses a unrecognized risk that will catch everyone off gaurd?"
	* ~~[Silas](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Silas%20Clarke.md): "There is a warrant out for all of our arrests for an alleged crime that we know that we haven't committed, that the [[city magistrate]] truly believes that we are guilty"~~
* [Eta](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Eta.md): "[Dewind](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewind%20Merigar.md), how close are you to your current obejctive, and what is the shape of the ground under your boots?"
	* [Dewind](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewind%20Merigar.md): "I can feel my foot tapping on a wooden floor, with a room below it. ... I think I'm on a stage. And we were just starting to get some informatoin about this... [tower](../Locations/tower.md). I've never been to this town before, but this [tower](../Locations/tower.md) in [Cleoro](../Locations/Cleoro.md)... why does it signify struggles?"
*
