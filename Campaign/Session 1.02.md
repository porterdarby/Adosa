* Running through the undergroun
	* [Silas](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Silas%20Clarke.md) went right, [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md) followed.
	* [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md) is able to "Suggestion" [Barnabas](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Barnabas.md) into leading us out. [Golem](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Golem.md) notices that the chains are tensioned, attempting to stop [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md)
	* [Golem](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Golem.md) notices a space that the chains are connected to some sort of portcullis (segregate bits of the corridor)
	* [Barnabas](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Barnabas.md) is pointing out paths/ways to go/ways to not go
	* [Silas](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Silas%20Clarke.md) drops a winch, so that a portcullis directs us
* [Barnabas](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Barnabas.md) urged [the Party](../Entities/Player%20Characters/The%20Party.md) towards a stairwell, leading down
	* The jail is in the warehouse district. Area is destroyed after [[a fight]]

	* [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md) is looking for artifacts
* Area has shifted visibly
	* Shifted to blasted mortar and rubble
	* Much more level ceiling over this space (50-60 feet)
	* There are other walls that have crumbled; ground looks to be made of cobblestone
	* Looks like we were spat out on an alleyway/street level in this [subcity](../Locations/Adosa/Cleoro's%20Undercity.md)
* [Barnabas](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Barnabas.md): "Yes, we are no longer back there... which is good. I have gone no further than this... and why am I... I need to go now... Goodbye!"
* (28 Survival) It takes a bit to find anything meaningful, we are looking for water
	* An area that is this cavernous and abandoned probably has some sort of creature 
	* [Golem](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Golem.md) starts looking for mildew/growth, indicating not just burnt/barren stone; recognition that there is moldy growth
	* Corridor with more worked stone
	* Mold grows heavier
	* Moss seems to grow heavier to the west, but hear trickling of water to the north
	* Attacked by some sort of cockroach enemy
		* Corrodes steel
	* Continuing to head north, attacked by another rust monster and a couple of ochre jellies
	* Everyone starts running away from the rust monsters and jellies, see the water to the south and a path to the north
	* [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md) starts running to the north, with the sound of Rust Monsters following from all directions (except north); [the Party](../Entities/Player%20Characters/The%20Party.md) follows, the path starts winding downhill
	* See a water feature curving along the path; rushing south under covered rock
	* [The Party](../Entities/Player%20Characters/The%20Party.md) continues running; [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md) and [Golem](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Golem.md) start throwing steel items behind them, and the rust monsters seem to stop following them.
* 50 foot tall room, large antechamber
	* Moisture, dripping rock, natural growths
	* [Silas](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Silas%20Clarke.md) notices a "safehouse" symbol in the cavern (Rogue's Cant); find a ladder baked into the natural world
	* Ladder leads to a low tunnel/crawlspace; Symbol "Surface", and an eye: "Look Out"; Trapdoor in a cellar door, behind a business
	* [Silas](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Silas%20Clarke.md)peeks out into an alleyway
	* We head east, towards [the Ritten Down](../Locations/Adosa/The%20Ritten%20Down.md). Everyone attempts to sleep
* [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md) starts dreaming

	* Blood leeching from the center of [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md)
