	* University complex in the south-west part of town
* In [the Hexed Essence](../Locations/Adosa/The%20Hexed%20Essence.md):
	* [Uuth](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Uuth.md) is trying to buy a component pouch
	* [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md) is flirting with two college girls by discussing following [Uuth](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Uuth.md) around
		* The 2-inch tall skeleton that [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md) is playing with says "That's not very nice!", lightly slaps [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md) on the face
		* [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md) pulls out [Sherff S'lltak](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Sherff%20S'lltak.md)'s head out of his bag, causing the girls to run out.
		* [Nibby](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Nibby.md): "You all need to get out of here _immediately_. You are not allowed in here ever again."
			* Effectively [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md) and [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md) are trespassed.
		* [Nibby](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Nibby.md) sells the component pouch to [Uuth](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Uuth.md) for _only_ 10 gold. [Uuth](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Uuth.md) says that he will return the favor if she calls, and she very worryingly says "I will keep this in mind"
* Head north-east to the [Towers of the Knights](../Locations/Adosa/Towers%20of%20the%20Knights.md)
	* Tower is covered in constellations
	* [Idrissa](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Idrissa.md) doesn't know why we are coming. She's walking along the edge of the room
	* [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md): "We have come to bring our spoils of victory."
	* The edge of the room is a constant nightscape; does not look like [Cleoro](../Locations/Adosa/Cleoro.md)
	* [Idrissa](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Idrissa.md) says that [Eihaley Cindermace](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Eihaley%20Cindermace.md) is an adept of [Sir Yervhan](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Yervhan.md)

		* [Idrissa](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Idrissa.md): "Am I to take it that this werewolf was a denizen of [Ichana](../Locations/Ichana/Ichana.md)?"
		* [Dewende](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Dewende%20Merigar.md) shows his notes on the markings found on the minotaur werewolf
		* "No such knowledge has ever left their border." The fact that we have found some bloodmagic outside their border doesn't bode well.
		* "The reason that I have asked to seek out the imp is fear of Zalt."
			* Zalt is a terrible power
			* If [Ichana](../Locations/Ichana/Ichana.md) is involved, it is implied there is an alliance with Zalt, that's an issue
			* [Adosa](../Locations/Adosa/Adosa.md) wouldn't be able to support a war on 3 fronts
		* "Cleoro's downfall is a matter of fact. However, the terms on which it occurs is not."
		* [Idrissa](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Idrissa.md)'s vision: Yawning sinkhole, with the 5 towers are teeth. Flames rise high; fires over the outer walls looking like a bonfire
		* She believes that [the Party](../Entities/Player%20Characters/The%20Party.md) might be "optimistic enough" to change the future
		* We mention that [Sherff S'lltak](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Sherff%20S'lltak.md) arrested us for the murder of [Noel McCardiganagin](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Noel%20McCardiganagin.md)
		* [Idrissa](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Idrissa.md) casts Mage Hand, grabbing something. She casts Dispel Magic on the faerie. The faerie implies that [Darcough](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Darcough%20Damar.md) destroyed her shop. Idrissa makes the faerie pass out, and then "captures" the faerie, who is whisked away
		* Idrissa continues to look at the armillary in the center of the tower
	* Murder of [Noel McCardiganagin](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Noel%20McCardiganagin.md):
		* Murdered in a church on the east side of town
	* Towards the east in particular, [Idrissa](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Idrissa.md)'s vision has begin to wane
		* Not just in the east; first time recently her sight has been so incomplete
	* Piece of paper floats down; [Silas](../Entities/Player%20Characters/Silas%20Clarke.md) grabs it
		* Indicates a location to the east, significant black X
		* "The abandoned building where the body of [Noel McCardiganagin](../Entities/Non-player%20Charatcters/Noel%20McCardiganagin.md) was found"
* Each of the knights contributes to the guard of the city
