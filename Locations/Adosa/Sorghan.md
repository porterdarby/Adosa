Sorghan is a town near the heart of [Adosa](Adosa/Adosa.md). Nestled between the [Dragonfly River](Adosa/Dragonfly%20River.md) to the West and the [Unterbrech Peaks](Unterbrech%20Peaks.md) to the South and East, Sorghan serves as a stopping point along Adosaâ€™s major trade route. It is a town of tradespeople, who work the various ores brought in from the nearby mines into useful equipment and items before exporting them.

Sentiments within the town are less directly sympathetic to mages of various persuasions, perhaps owing to the town's reliance on martial trade in the export of their weapons and armor.

Food has always been in short supply here; being inland, Sorghan's residents have historically been the first to tighten their belts in times of famine, and last to be fed when plenty returns to the land.

As a result, morale here is currently incredibly high. With the renewed exports from the agricultural communities of the [Everiel](Everiel/Everiel.md), it is a time of plenty. The town is holding its harvest festival for the first time in a decade and more.
