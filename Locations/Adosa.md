Adosa is an aristocratic nation within the world of [Elleria](Elleria.md). It is, first and foremost, a nation of magic. Magic study and magical items of minor convenience bleed freely into the substance of daily life here, though technological level is still roughly that of the middle ages. Naturally there is some regulation of the use of arcane abilities to harm others or influence them maliciously, but otherwise research and study into the different spheres is actively encouraged and those who are recognized practitioners enjoy a not-so-subtle increase in their social status as a result.

This philosophy regarding the free use of magic has been at the center of the country's main source of conflict for the past century and more; [Everiel](Everiel.md), to the East, has outright banned magic, going so far as to execute those suspected of practicing or researching the topic inside of their borders. This has led to a long string of bloody battles which have dominated the lives of those living out [Everiel](Everiel.md). Notably a ceasefire was achieved some 5 years ago, and while no armistice has ever been formally signed, there is now a kind of uneasy peace between the two nations.

And so, for the first time in a long time, the center of Adosa's affairs has shifted inwards. Those eastern cities, formerly the breadbasket of the country, are once again producing abundant food. The aristocracy have taken up the matter of the monstrous creatures within their own borders, and aim to have them eliminated wholesale. And those mages who had previously been tied up in military deployments are now allowed to freely pursue their craft, putting high bounties on the discovery of any artifact or ruin which might contain hints of long-lost arts.

# Legal System
* Violent and property crimes are prosecuted with extremely prejudice.
* Violent and property crimes without magic are seen as barbaric, therefore prosecuted well.
